## ðŸ“‚ Data Management

- `data/sample/` â†’ contains a **small sample dataset** (few thousand rows) included in this repo for testing and demos.  
- `data/raw/` â†’ full datasets (GBs) should be downloaded manually. See [data/raw/README.md](data/raw/README.md) for links.  
- `data/processed/` â†’ generated artifacts (cleaned data, embeddings, clustering outputs). Ignored by Git.  

âš¡ Tip: Start with the sample dataset to test the pipeline, then swap in the full dataset by placing it in `data/raw/`.
